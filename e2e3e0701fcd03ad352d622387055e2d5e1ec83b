      "message": "I agree.. but I am not understanding one part even that when chown -R onap:onap /opt is being done so by default everything inside will be owned by ONAP user including the start.sh or other scripts too !\n\nDockerFile has USER onap at #23 and entry point running the start.sh, if I remove #18 still it #24 fails with permission issues, which shouldn\u0027t be case !\n\nThat\u0027s where I added 777 on /opt -\u003e as \n1) /opt contains project related files \n2) it creates new files or directories within some subfolder of /opt directory during runtime\n\nSo to avoid any issue during runtime, changing /opt directory permission helps !",
