I can\u0027t see it in the code so i assume the script will have to pass this. \nThe script developer should not have to pass this information otherwise it will be a nightmare to update the basic auth when you have 100s of CBA with the authorization headers hardcoded in the code.",

If anybody change an API authentication credentials should also remember to update them here. This kind of data, in my opinion, should be provided as script arguments. You can store them in one place, but not in public repository (some config file, database etc.) and get them only for script call.",
