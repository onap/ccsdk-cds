      "message": "I noticed that this directory will still be owned by root in this image. Is this the issue you are trying to address? If so i think this VOLUME instruction is the problem. The docs says\n\n\"if any build steps change the data within the volume after it has been declared, those changes will be discarded.\"\nhttps://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume\n\nThat means chown in line 25 will have no on that directory.\n\nThink we can remove this line, volume bindings will still work without it.",
