#  Imperative workflow UAT
#
#  The CBA has 4 node-templates: execute-script-N(1..4), which all execute TestScript.kt
#  The kotlin script will either succeed or fail depending on request input values
#  example input:
#    "uat-wf-request": {
#        "service-instance-id": {},
#        "failing-steps": {
#           "assign": true
#           "deploy-recover": true
#        }
#    }
#  The kotlin script will look for failing-steps[stepName], if value is present and true
#  an exception will be thrown, causing the step to fail.
#
#  All workflows end with running CollectorScripts.kt which will produce the final
#  response payload with the execution results.
