Wordpress CNF in CDS (POC)
==========================

This demo by CableLabs shows an easy to use POC how to use/deploy VNFs in CDS and do resource asignment.

Detailed description will follow as soon as there is an acknowledgement from CableLabs that content can be published.

Goal is to use CDS (ONAP) in a very simple and understandable way. Azure, AWS
and Kubernetes are used as VIMs trough scripting. Wordpress is used as a VNF.

This demo was tested on Frankfurt.
