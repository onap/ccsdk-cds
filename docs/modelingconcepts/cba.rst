-------------------------------------

The **C**\ ontroller **B**\ lueprint **A**\ rchive is the overall service design, fully model-driven, intent based
**package** needed for SELF SERVICE provisioning and configuration management automation.

The CBA is **.zip** file, comprised of the following folder structure, the files may vary:

.. code-block language is required for ReadTheDocs to render code-blocks. Python set as default.
