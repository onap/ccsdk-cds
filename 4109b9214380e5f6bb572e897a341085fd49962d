      "message": "Hi Jozsef, on application.properties and application-dev.properties I added a real life example, the configuration we wanted to use in CDS Blueprintsprocessor, but on tests I added any-db to present that it doesn\u0027t need to be any predefined value - it can be anything user configure by itself. If they wants to use cds-db, cps-db, so-db or whatever-db it\u0027s possible",

      "message": "The application code should not make assumptions on external configuration overrides. Adding values to application.properties and application-dev.properties signals introduction of new behaviors/features. The purpose of this patch is just to enable users to add new databases to the configuration, rather than introducing cds-db as a default source.\n\nAlso if my memory servers me well, application.properties packaged inside the JAR is still being read, but values are overridden by the external application.properties file, which means that if you have property A in the packaged file and property B in the external, the application will load both A and B. That\u0027s why I hesitate adding new properties unless they have a purpose.\n\nI suggest we only keep the application-test.properties in this submission.",
